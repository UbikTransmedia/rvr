*RVR 0.5 - Guillem Carbonell - g@ubik.bz - 2019*

Hello WoVRd!
============

Welcome to Ruby Virtual Reality. This blueprint is meant to help you build cybernetic VR experiences, which means:

* WebVR (A-frame) as the canvas
* Concurrent users
* Restful API
* Asincronous queries (jQuery) in 3D
* Runtime console (Dungeon Master)
* Controllers, controllers, controllers!

...which implies:

* Flow > Graphics
* Interacting > Watching
* Connected > Lonely

Log
-----------

* Holodeck is working: you load code in a database, and code is passed to the 3D scene.
* Next: polish holodeck skills
* Next: [new demo]: inboun API to scene.
* Pending: multiuser scene

But give it some time. It just started! ^_^
